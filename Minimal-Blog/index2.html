				I am so happy to be writing in my journal! I love writing down my thoughts, experiences and dreams. My journal is a safe place where I can be myself and express my emotions without fear of being judged. I like to write with a pink pen on the white pages, it gives my writing a girly touch. As a high school student, I have so much to write about! My journal allows me to remember all the magical moments that make life an exciting adventure. I can't wait to continue writing and sharing my most intimate stories and thoughts with you.

				Dear diary,<br> 
				I couldn't stand being bullied at school anymore. The insults, mockery and bullying had become unbearable. So I decided to run away for a few days to meet my boyfriend who lives in the south of Europe. I saved up some money, but not enough to buy a plane ticket, so I just left with my backpack. It was hard to lie to my parents, but I needed to escape.

				When I arrived, I realized that I couldn't stay at my boyfriend's house forever, and that I had to find a way to get away from my parents. So I decided to look for an internship in the south, at my favorite video game publisher. I contacted the company and they accepted to host me. They gave me a tour of the company for a whole afternoon, it was great! I left them a little message on Google map with my personal gmail account ;)

				I can't wait to start my internship and learn more about the video game industry. I am determined to prove to my parents that I am capable of making decisions and taking care of myself. I hope this internship will help me gain confidence and discover new opportunities for my future.

				In the meantime, I will take advantage of these few days to relax and recharge. I am grateful to have a loving and supportive boyfriend, and I hope that everything will go well for me in the future.

				See you soon, dear diary.

				Dear diary,<br> 
				Today I had an incredible experience. On my way home from school, I saw a kitten all alone and lost on the street. He was so cute that I couldn't help but reach out and pet him. I looked for potential owners in the neighborhood, but no one seemed to know him. So I decided to take him home to feed and pet him. I hope he will find his family soon, but in the meantime, I am happy to have him by my side, he is a great support in this difficult moment.

				Dear Diary,<br>  
				Tonight I attended a concert of my favorite band. I loved every moment of the show. The music, the lights, the atmosphere... everything was perfect. I sang and danced like I was alone in the world, not caring what anyone else thought. It was a magical evening that I will never forget. I realized that music has the power to transport us to another place and make us feel incredible emotions.

				 Yesterday I went to visit my grandmother today. We talked about her youth and all the adventures she had.

She taught me that everyone has a unique story and that we should all take the time to listen to each other's stories. It was an emotional day, and I am grateful to have had it.
